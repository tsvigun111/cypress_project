# Product Listing Page Bug Report

## Title:

Intermittent Display of Incorrect Items in Filtered Results on Product Listing Page

## Description:

When a user filters items by category on the product listing page, items from other categories intermittently appear in the filtered results. This issue occurs unpredictably and affects the user experience by displaying irrelevant products.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Navigate to the product listing page of the React-based application.
2. Apply a filter by selecting a specific category (e.g., "Electronics").
3. Observe the filtered results.

**Reproduction Rate**: Intermittent (occurs approximately 30% of the time).

## Expected Result:

Only items belonging to the selected category (e.g., "Electronics") should be displayed in the filtered results.

## Actual Result:

Items from other categories (e.g., "Clothing", "Home Appliances") intermittently appear in the filtered results.

## Severity:

**Medium**

- **Impact**: This issue affects the usability of the filtering feature, leading to a poor user experience.
- **Scope**: The issue is intermittent and does not completely break functionality but causes confusion for users.

## Priority:

**High**

- **Reason**: Filtering is a core feature of the product listing page, and incorrect results can lead to user frustration and potential loss of trust.

## Additional Information:

- **Browser Type/Version**:
  - Chrome v115 (Issue observed)
  - Firefox v116 (Issue observed)
  - Safari v16.5 (Issue not observed)
- **Network Conditions**:
  - Issue occurs on both high-speed (Wi-Fi) and low-speed (3G) networks.
- **Device**:
  - Desktop (Windows 10, macOS)
  - Mobile (iOS, Android)
- **Console Errors**:
  - No errors or warnings are logged in the browser console.
- **API Response**:
  - The API response for filtered items occasionally includes items from other categories.
- **Reproduction Steps for Developers**:
  - Check the API response payload when the issue occurs.
  - Verify if the filtering logic in the frontend is correctly applied to the API response.

2. [Network log from Chrome DevTools showing the API response payload](./logs/network-log.json).

## Root Cause (Suspected):

- The issue may be caused by:
  - Incorrect filtering logic in the frontend code.
  - A race condition in the API request/response handling.
  - Caching issues where stale data is being displayed.

## Suggested Fix:

1. Verify the filtering logic in the frontend to ensure it correctly processes the API response.
2. Check for race conditions in the API request/response handling.
3. Ensure that cached data is invalidated or updated when a new filter is applied.
