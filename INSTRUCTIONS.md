# Cypress Testing Assessment for Memberstack

## Overview

This assessment evaluates your ability to create effective Cypress tests for a CRUD application. You'll be testing a React-based user management system that allows users to be created, read, updated, and deleted.

## Time Allocation (2 hours)

- 15 minutes: Environment setup and application review
- 90 minutes: Test development and bug hunting (do not edit the application code)
- 15 minutes: Documentation and bug reporting

## Assessment Goals

1. Create a comprehensive Cypress test suite that covers all CRUD operations
2. Identify and document any bugs or edge cases you discover
3. Demonstrate best practices in Cypress test organization and structure

## Application Under Test

The application is a user management system that includes:

- **Create**: Adding new users with name, email, role, and status
- **Read**: Viewing a list of all users in a table format
- **Update**: Editing existing user information
- **Delete**: Removing users from the system
- **Status Toggle**: Changing user status between active/inactive

The app uses a simulated API service with setTimeout to mimic real-world conditions like network delays and occasional failures.

## Testing Requirements

Your test suite should:

1. **Cover all CRUD operations**:

   - Creating users with different roles and statuses
   - Reading the user list and verifying display of all fields
   - Updating existing users
   - Deleting users
   - Toggling user status

2. **Include validation testing**:

   - Form field validation (required fields, email format)
   - Error message display
   - Edge cases in input handling (spaces, capitalization)
   - API error handling
   - Loading/submitting states

3. **Follow best practices**:
   - Use appropriate selectors (preferring data-cy attributes)
   - Implement proper test organization (describe/context/it blocks)
   - Use meaningful test descriptions
   - Avoid test interdependencies
   - Implement proper waiting strategies for async operations
   - Handle API responses and simulate network failures
   - Use custom commands when appropriate

## Bug Hunting Challenge

The application contains several subtle bugs or edge cases. Your test suite should identify as many of these issues as possible. For each bug you find, document:

1. A clear description of the bug
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Expected vs. actual behavior
4. The test that identified the bug
5. Potential fix recommendation (optional)

Examples of the types of bugs that might exist:

- Form validation issues
- Data handling edge cases
- API error handling problems
- Status toggle inconsistencies
- State management issues during editing
- Error state persistence
- Duplicate detection problems

## Test Strategy Recommendations

Consider these approaches in your testing:

- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Test with various input types and lengths
- Test API failures and error handling
- Test form state after failed submissions
- Test race conditions with rapid interactions
- Test accessibility using Cypress accessibility tooling
- Test UI state during async operations

## Deliverables

1. A complete Cypress test suite
2. A document listing all identified bugs with details
3. A brief explanation of your testing approach and strategy
4. Any custom commands or utilities you've created
5. Optional: Suggestions for improving the application's testability

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the application with `npm start`
4. Run Cypress with `npm run cypress:open`

A sample test file has been provided as a starting point, but you should create your own comprehensive test suite.

## Evaluation Criteria

You'll be evaluated on:

1. **Test Coverage**: How comprehensively you've tested the application
2. **Bug Discovery**: Number and quality of bugs identified
3. **Code Quality**: Structure, readability, and maintainability of your tests
4. **Testing Approach**: Strategy, organization, and best practices
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Attention to detail in finding subtle issues

## Hints and Tips

- Utilize Cypress' automatic waiting and retry functionality
- Make use of Cypress commands like `.should()` with appropriate assertions
- Consider using custom commands for repetitive operations
- Make your tests resilient to state changes and UI updates
- Remember to test both UI and business logic
- Don't forget to test error states and recovery paths
